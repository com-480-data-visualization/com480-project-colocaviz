### Dataset
This project uses two dataset on food impacts :

The first one was created by (Petterson et al. 2021) ["A multilevel carbon and water footprint dataset of food commodities"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00909-8). It's a dataset reviewing the literature on the carbon and water footprint of different food commodities. The output is an excel file giving the mean carbon footprint of aliment in CO2eq/g, and the water footprint in liters of water/kg across the studies. The foods are categorized by typologies and subtypologies. Additionnal information about the studies and some basic statistic across studies are also available. 
In our project this dataset is the excel "SuEatableLife_Food_Fooprint_database.xlsx" and is accessible in our data folder.

The second dataset comes from the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL). The dataset compiles crop and livestock statistics for 278 products wordlwide since 1961. It contains information about the area harvested, yield, production, stocks, and the number of producing animals slaugthered. More details can be found in the [agricultural production statistic report](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/ab36b259-d641-4ded-8832-32f579685be7)

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data
